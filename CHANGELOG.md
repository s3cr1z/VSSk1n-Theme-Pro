## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Lynx Brand Themes Pack**: A new collection of 50 developer brand-inspired themes (100 theme files in total — dark and light variants for each brand). Each theme keeps the full Lynx Pro UI coverage (450+ color keys, semantic tokens, syntax scopes) and routes the brand's official accent through every surface, while preserving the universal diagnostic palette (`#ff5c6a` error / `#f5c842` warning / `#4dc9ff` info) and the dim brand-tinted comment dimming pattern.
  - **Web platforms**: GitHub, GitLab, Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, DigitalOcean, Heroku
  - **Containers & orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes
  - **Cloud providers**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
  - **Backends as a service**: Firebase, Supabase
  - **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis
  - **Payments / comms**: Stripe, Twilio, Slack, Discord
  - **Design / productivity**: Figma, Notion, Linear, Raycast
  - **UI / framework**: Tailwind CSS, Next.js, Nuxt, Svelte, Vue, React, Angular, Astro, Remix, Vite
  - **Languages**: Rust, Go, Python, TypeScript, Swift, Kotlin
  - **Runtimes**: Deno, Bun, npm
  - **Server frameworks**: Laravel, Django, Spring
  - **Infrastructure / observability**: Terraform, Datadog
  - **Other**: Spotify
- **Generator pipeline**: New `scripts/generate-brand-theme.js` derives the brand variants from `01_Lynx-Dark-theme.json` and `02_Lynx-Light-theme.json` so every brand stays in sync with the canonical Lynx base, including auto-corrected accent lightness to keep function colors at ≥ 3:1 contrast against the editor surface.
- **QA harness**: New `scripts/qa-contrast.js` audits text / function / comment / error contrast ratios across all 100 themes. All themes pass the configured WCAG thresholds.

### Documentation

- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` with the `src/themes/brands/` directory structure and the brand generator pipeline.
- Updated `README.md` with a Brand Themes Pack section listing all 50 brands.
